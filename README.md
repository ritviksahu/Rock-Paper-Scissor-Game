# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
The "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game created using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b> provides a classic and interactive user experience. 
<br>
1. The HTML file structures the webpage, presenting a title, buttons for the player to select their move (rock, paper, or scissors), and a result display area. 
<br>
2. The CSS file styles the elements, creating a visually appealing and responsive design.
<br>
3. The JavaScript file defines the game logic. When a player makes a choice by clicking a button, the program randomly selects the computer's move. 

The <b>result</b> is determined by comparing the player's choice to the computer's, and the outcome (win, lose, or draw) is displayed on the webpage in a clear and user-friendly manner.
